TIS-100 Solutions
=================

My solutions to the assembly language programming game [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/).

Since [TIS-100 Pad](http://www.tis100pad.com/) appears to be down at this time of writing, images for the node/instruction layouts are also included in this repository.
